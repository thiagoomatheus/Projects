## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS
  - DOM Manipulation
  - Events
  - Async Function
  - API

### What I learned

This project helped me to fix the concepts previously learned about using APIs. With this project I was able to use the fetch request and handle the data coming from the API.

This project also reinforces the importance of JSON for data manipulation. I could see how much this process is facilitated by this data formatting pattern.
