### What I learned

I started this project after studying basic Javascript in order to fix the knowledge learned. Thus, in this project I put into practice knowledge about DOM manipulation, making changes to the page through the data received by the input, also, it was worked with user events via slider and toggle, in addition to basic price calculations. Another in-depth knowledge was the use of factory functions, used to create plans that the user could choose from.

Despite already having a base of CSS studies and projects, this project provided me with a challenge because it was the first time I worked with a slider. So, I had to do additional research to make the slider as suggested in the project. I feel that I was able to evolve in CSS with this project, getting out of my comfort zone.

In this project I also learned the importance of testing in different browsers, precisely because the slider works differently in each browser. I was convinced that tests not only on different screen sizes, but on different browsers are very important for a job well done on the front-end.

### Useful resources

- [Creating A Custom Range Input That Looks Consistent Across All Browsers](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/12/create-custom-range-input-consistent-browsers/) - This article helped me a lot in styling the slider as it provides a detailed explanation of how the range input works and the variations in browsers.
