### What I learned

While working on this project, I focused on improving my responsive design skills, which was a key challenge. The provided Figma design file presented a unique learning opportunity; I gained firsthand experience in interpreting and implementing a pre-designed layout. Additionally, managing the various font styles and sizes highlighted the importance of UI/UX in ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. This project challenged me to think critically about how design choices impact the user experience.

Also, this project was where I had my first contact with JavaScript. During the project I took a break to learn more about JS. Therefore, I could apply the concepts studied in this time.
